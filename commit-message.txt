feat(headless): reduce noise in non-interactive mode

This commit introduces several changes to reduce the amount of noise printed to STDOUT when running in non-interactive (headless) mode.

The following changes have been made:

- **`gemini.tsx`**: The `setWindowTitle` function is now only called when `process.stdin.isTTY` is true, preventing the window title from being set in non-interactive sessions.
- **`nonInteractiveCli.ts`**: The `getResponseText` function now checks for and filters out "thoughts" from the model's response, so they are not printed to STDOUT.
- **`sandbox.ts`**: The "using macos seatbelt..." message is now logged to STDERR instead of STDOUT.
- **`gitIgnoreParser.ts`**: The "Loaded X patterns" message is now logged to STDERR instead of STDOUT.

These changes ensure that the output of the CLI is clean and contains only the model's response when running in non-interactive mode.
