# Refactoring Status

This document summarizes the progress of the CLI/Core decoupling refactoring effort.

## Current State

We have successfully established a stable baseline for the project. All packages are building successfully, and all automated tests are passing.

## Progress Against Plan

We are currently in the middle of **Step 3: Refactor Interactive Mode to Use `ChatSession`** from the `REFACTORING_PLAN.md`.

### Completed Work:

1.  **`core` Package Refactoring:**
    - The new `ChatSession` class has been created and implemented in `packages/core/src/core/chatSession.ts`.
    - It now encapsulates the entire conversation lifecycle, including tool calls and event-based communication.
    - The public API of the `core` package has been updated to export `ChatSession` and its related types (`ChatEvent`, `ChatEventSource`).

2.  **Non-Interactive CLI Refactoring (`runNonInteractive`):**
    - The non-interactive mode has been fully refactored to use the new `ChatSession`.
    - Integration tests (`nonInteractiveCli.integration.test.ts`) and unit tests (`nonInteractiveCli.test.ts`) have been updated to reflect these changes and are passing.

3.  **Interactive CLI (`App.tsx`) - Initial Steps:**
    - The new `useChatSession` hook has been created in `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useChatSession.ts` to manage the `ChatSession` within the React UI.
    - A corresponding test file for the new hook has been created and is passing.

## Next Steps

The immediate next action is to continue with Step 3:

-   Integrate the `useChatSession` hook into the main `App.tsx` component.
-   Remove the now-obsolete `useGeminiStream` hook.
-   Adapt the `App.tsx` component and its children to consume the `events` and `loading` state from `useChatSession`, replacing the old state management logic.
